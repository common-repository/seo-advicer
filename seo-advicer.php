Some people call ALT tag, but it's wrong ALT is an HTML attribute
One method to optimize an image is filling Image ALT attribute
Add Image ALT - &lt;img src=\"MyHomeImage.png\" <b>alt=\"Image Shows My Home\"</b>&gt;
Second method to optimize an image is adding your keyword into the Image File Name
Third method to optimize an image is adding Image Meta Data
You could use Photoshop to incude Meta Data to your images
For adding Image Meta Data, Go <i>File > File Info</i> from Photoshop
Another way to optimize an image is reducing its File Size

Don't add more than 2 Keywords for Meta Keyword Tag & Image Meta Data
Adding hundreds of keywords inside Meta Keyword tag is known as Keyword Stuffing
You know what, Keyword Stuffing can still occur in your content too
